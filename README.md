# Phase 2 Project - Natalya Doris

## Project Overview

In this project, I use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Business Problem

Real estate company Royal Homes is looking to better understand the Kings County housing market before they finalize their business strategy. We seek to answer the following questions: what types of homes should they be looking to sell to make the most profit? What features lend towards higher sale prices?

### Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this GitHub repository.

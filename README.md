# Phase 2 Project - Natalya Doris

## Project Overview

In this project, I use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you **ignore** some or all of the following features:

* `date`
* `view`
* `sqft_above`
* `sqft_basement`
* `yr_renovated`
* `zipcode`
* `lat`
* `long`
* `sqft_living15`
* `sqft_lot15`

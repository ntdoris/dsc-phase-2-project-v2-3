# Phase 2 Project - Natalya Doris

## Project Overview

In this project, I use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Business Problem

Real estate company Royal Homes is looking to better understand the Kings County housing market before they finalize their business strategy. We seek to answer the following questions: what types of homes should they be looking to sell to make the most profit? What features lend towards higher sale prices?

### Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this GitHub repository. 

The data contains the following columns:

* 'bedrooms': number of bedrooms
* 'bathrooms': number of bathrooms
* 'floors', # number of floors (levels) in the house
* 'waterfront', # whether the house is on the waterfront
* 'view', # quality of view from house
* 'condition': how good the overall condition of the house is; related to maintenance of house.
* 'grade': overall grade of the house; related to the construction and design of the house
* 'zipcode': zip code
* 'sqft_living': sq. ft. of living space
* 'sqft_lot': Square footage of the lot
* 'sqft_above': Square footage of house apart from basement
* 'yr_built': year house was built
* 'sqft_living15': sq. ft. of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
* 'sqft_lot15': sq. ft. of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
* 'mth_sold': month house was sold
* 'yr_sold': year house was sold
* 'renovated': whether a house had a year populated in the yr_renovated column
